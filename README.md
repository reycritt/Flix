- [ ] Collection View AutoLayout (+2)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The CollectionView was very difficult to modify. The constraints of the detailed view, although placed correctly, does not show the full view; I assumed a scrollview could be used instead, but due to how late this idea came to mind it became extremely difficult to modify and relocate views.

### Notes
Recreating the TableView push navigation with the CollectionView was tough to refollow, but important to redo to remind myself how it works. Also, the sizes of the images in the CollectionView cells are improperly sized.
